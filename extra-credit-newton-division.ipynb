{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm\">Newton-Raphson Division</a> is a means to divide by multiplying. Why would you want to do that? Well, even for computers division is harder (read slower) than multiplying.The trick is that $p/q$ is simply $p \\cdot (1/q)$, so finding a means to compute a reciprocal by multiplying will reduce division to multiplication.  (This trick is used by <a href=\"http://www.yeppp.info/resources/ppam-presentation.pdf\">yeppp</a>, a high performance library for computational mathematics.)</p>","metadata":{}},
